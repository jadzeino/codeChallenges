# About
This repository contains a collection of algorithmic problem-solving implementations written in JavaScript. It includes solutions to common coding challenges such as binary gaps, cyclic rotations, finding missing integers, and more. Each file focuses on solving a specific problem using efficient and optimized approaches.

# Algorithm Problem Solutions

This repository includes solutions to various algorithmic challenges, implemented in JavaScript. These problems focus on array manipulation, number theory, optimization, and logical puzzles. Each JavaScript file represents a unique coding problem, providing efficient and clear solutions.

## Features

- **BinaryGap.js**: Finds the maximum binary gap in a number's binary representation.
- **CountDiv.js**: Counts the number of integers divisible by a given number within a range.
- **CyclicRotation.js**: Performs cyclic rotation on an array.
- **FrogJump.js**: Calculates minimum jumps for a frog to reach the other side of a river.
- **FrogRiverOne.js**: Determines the earliest time a frog can cross a river.
- **GenomicRangeQuery.js**: Answers genomic range queries using prefix sums.
- **MaxCountersOptimized.js**: Optimizes the operation of a max counter with resets.
- **MissingIntger.js**: Finds the smallest missing positive integer from an array.
- **OddOccurrencesInArray.js**: Identifies the element that occurs an odd number of times in an array.
- **TapeEquilibrium.js**: Minimizes the difference between two parts of a split array.
- **PermCheck.js**: Verifies if an array is a permutation.
- **merging2Packages.js**: Merges two packages efficiently.
- **getEmailInfo.js**: Retrieves information from an email dataset.

## Usage

Each file can be run independently using Node.js. To execute a specific algorithm, run the following command:

```bash
node filename.js
```
